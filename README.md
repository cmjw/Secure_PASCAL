# Secure Pascal

The "secure_pascal" directories contains the main project files and detailed build instructions.

1. secure_pascal1 contains a version of the project that I was working on to rewrite the compiler
from scratch using what I wrote before as a reference.

2. secure_pascal2 contains a version of the projects that builds directly on my previous Pascal 
compiler projects.

# Original Pascal Compiler 
The files are for reference only right now. 
I am still working on differentiating the project files from different stages that are not compatible.

I moved these files to another repo to keep this one organized:
https://github.com/cmjw/PASCAL_Compiler_Projects

All lexer and parser files/proejcts are now built, and there are detailed build instructions in this 
repo. 

# Documentation

A work in progress.
