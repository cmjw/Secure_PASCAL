# Secure Pascal

The src directory contains the main project code and build instructions.

## Example Usage

$ bash build.sh
$ bash run.sh ../example/simple.pas

# Examples

The examples directory contains sample .pas files to test the lexer and parser.

# Original Pascal Compiler 
The files are for reference only right now. 
I am still working on differentiating the project files from different stages that are not compatible.

I moved these files to another repo to keep this one organized:
https://github.com/cmjw/PASCAL_Compiler_Projects

All lexer and parser files/proejcts are now built, and there are detailed build instructions in this 
repo. 

# Documentation

A work in progress.
