# Parser Documentation

The parser is built using bison/yacc and C, located in parse.y.

## Grammar

The grammar is specified in parse.y. The highest level rule constructs a progam:

`program : PROGRAM IDENTIFIER LPAREN id_list RPAREN SEMICOLON lblock fdef_lists`

## Example

For a very simple program, a parse tree generated by the parser may look like: 

`(float simple (label ouput) (label (:= i 1)))`
